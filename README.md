# Text-Editor
Hello developers, <br> <br>
This is python based project that is simply a text editor.<br>
It makes use of python's rich libraries especially Tkinter that enables to put up a GUI and make the application simpler to use. 
<br><br>
I tried to keep it simple and avoid sophisticated functionalities. <br>
Try it out!
